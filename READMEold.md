YAPPER 2.0, new and improved! (forked branch for assignment 2 because ye why not)



“Yapper” - Twitter clone Documentation

Project Creators: 
Carl
Sander
Jakub

Github Repo: https://github.com/Jakubo0451/YAPPER
Live site: https://yapper-zwai.onrender.com/
Backend: https://yapper-4qux.onrender.com/ (when you try to use the backend it will have to load the first time, so login and accessing it the first time might be slow, but should work fine after that.) 
(note that you need to make an account in order to use the application and certain endpoints)

Technologies used

User Interface
For our frontend we’ve decided to use react. The reason behind is that it provides a fast, responsive SPA experience and it is widely used in modern web development. We have also used it as an opportunity to learn React and it generally suited our needs.

Processing / API
The “bulk” of the backend of the project has been written in python, specifically we have used the fastAPI python framework. It generally works well with PostgreSQL, it is easy to use and is asynchronous.

Data Storage:
PostgreSQL was used for data storage, it’s good for structured data like users and tweets and it is also free to host on render. The task also required us to use a relational database.

There were talks of implementing SQL injection prevention, but SQLAlchemy which we used for querying the database prevents this so there was no need to implement it. 



Hosting
We are hosting the entire project on render. All three parts of the project are split up and being hosted there. It’s great because we can host a PostgreSQL DB there for free (for a month...). It is also just extremely easy to use and free. I would also like to mention that the frontend and database are being hosted on one account and the API on another.



Setting it up locally
To set up the project locally you first need to clone the git repository.Then you want to navigate to the /frontend folder and run ‘npm i’ to install dependencies. To run the frontend you want to run ‘npm run start’, at which point the frontend will be up and running locally, connecting to the backend API hosted on Render. 



‘Flow’
User creates an account via the POST /users method. This requires a unique username and a password. We store the hashed password in the database together with the unique username.
User gets redirected to the login page, where they supply the username and password they made. They then get logged in via the /login route, which creates a token and stores it in localstorage for easy access. This token gets accessed when the user tries to edit and delete tweets, to make sure they can only delete and edit their own tweets. 
After logging in the user gets access to see all tweets posted by all users on the page. They can now also post, edit and delete their own tweets. If a tweet is posted by the logged in user, it will have an edit and delete button associated with it. The edit button brings up a text box where you can edit the tweet and tags, and the delete button brings up an alert box asking you if you want to delete the tweet. 
Searching
The user can search for hashtags, accounts and just general text in tweets via the search in the top right on the page
To search for users, start the search with @, example @john will return all users containing the word john
To search for hashtags, start the search with #, example #python and you will get all the tweets containing #python
To search for general text in tweets you don’t need a prefix, you just need to write what you want to search for, for example ‘weather’ to get all tweets containing the word weather. 
When the user is finished using the page, they can choose to log out via the X in the top-right corner. This will redirect you back to the login page.
